# VEX Robotics

__Community contributions through GitHub pull requests
are highly welcome and appreciated!!__—especially:
- Personal robot inventions; and
- Competition teams' design, code & demo materials over the years.

We intend this repository to be a comprehensive and open-to-the-community
collection of programming code—mostly in Python, some in other languages—and
related design and demo materials for/on robots based on various generations of
VEX robotics platforms, such as:
- VEX IQ;
- VEX V5; and
- VEX PRO.


For each robot, we experiment extensively with various ways to program it.
For example, we create and maintain multiple Python programs based on VEXcode
Python and Robot Mesh's 1st-generation Python and 2nd-generation Python B APIs.

For the sake of comprehensiveness, we maintain references to interesting robots
that community members have invented and shared about on Facebook, GitHub and
YouTube. Occasionally, we take copies of other developers' old programs
(with due credits) and modify those with the latest modern libraries.
